Hello Everyone!!
I’m R.Vaishnavi and I’m a student in SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I am currently pursuing B.Tech Computer Science. I have a keen interest in learning new things.
My strengths include trustworthy, disciplined, determined and dedicated.
I have a trouble saying “no” and I get impatient when projects run beyond the deadline. 
My skills are C, C++, HTML, MS Office, and Python language.
